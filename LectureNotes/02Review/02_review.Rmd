## Motivation

In our last set of slides, we

1. discussed the **motivation** for studying econometrics (metrics)

1. **introduced .mono[R]**â€”why we use it, what it can do

1. **started reviewing** material from your previous classes

These notes continue the review, building the foundation for some new topics (soon).

## Models and notation

We write our (simple) population model

$$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i $$

and our sample-based estimated regression model as

$$ y_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i + e_i $$

The regession model produces estimates for each observation:

$$ \hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i $$

which gives us the _best-fit_ line through our dataset.

**Question:** What do we mean by *best-fit* line?

**Answers:**

- The line that minimizes the sum of squared error (SSE)...

$$ \text{SSE} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} e_i^2 $$

<center>where</center>

$$ e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i $$


- Ordinary least squares (OLS) minimizes SSE.
- Based upon a set of (mostly palatable) assumptions, OLS provides
  - the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE),
  - the minimum variance, unbiased estimator
