# EC 421, Winter 2019

Welcome to **Economics 421: Introduction to Econometrics** (Winter 2019) at the University of Oregon (taught by [Edward Rubin](https://edrub.in)).

For information on the course specifics, please see the [syllabus](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC421W19/master/Syllabus/syllabus.pdf).

## Lecture slides

The slides below (linked by their topic) are .html files that will only work properly if you are connected to the internet. If you're going off grid, grab the PDFs (you'll miss out on gifs and interactive plots, but the equations will render correctly). I create the slides with [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki) in [R](cran.r-project.org). Thanks go to [Grant McDermott](grantmcdermott.com/) for helping me get going with `xaringan`.
